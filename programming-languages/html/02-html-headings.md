## HTML Headings
- Defined with `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags
- `<h1>` defines the most important heading
- `<h6>` defines the least important heading
- TODO: Redirect `font-size` to the relevant CSS note when available.
- Each HTML heading has a default size. To customize the size, you can use CSS `font-size` property.

### Notes
- Browsers automatically add some white space (margin) before and after a heading
- `<h1>` tag should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then `<h3>` and so on.
- A single HTML document should only have **one** `<h1>` tag for better SEO.
- Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text **BIG** or **bold**.
