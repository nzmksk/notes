## Compiled vs Interpreted Languages
| Compiled | Interpreted |
| --- | --- |
| Languages must be translated to machine-readable instructions (binary) using compilers before any code is executed. | Instructions are not precompiled for the target machine in a machine-readable form before any code is executed. |
